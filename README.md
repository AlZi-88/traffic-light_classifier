# traffic-light_classifier
Program to predict the active color of a traffic light

This program is part of the Udacity Nanodegree Program "Intro to Selfdriving Cars" (https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-self-driving-cars--nd113).

## Restrictions

For the moment this project is not yet able to run properly since training, test data and helper functions are missing. These missing points will be added in future. Beside that the algorithm itself is already working fine. For more deteils check out the [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/AlZi-88/traffic-light_classifier/blob/master/Traffic_Light_Classifier.ipynb).
